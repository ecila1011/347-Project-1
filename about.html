              <div class = p1> Hi! My name is Ava and I am the artist and owner of this shop! I am currently
                a senior in high school. I grew up in and still live in Ithaca, NY with my mom, step dad, and younger brother.
                Besides being an artist, I am also an athlete! I played soccer for a few years but my main sport
                is basketball! I haven't decided what I want to do once I graduate high school, but my dream is to
                be able to do my business and art full time.
